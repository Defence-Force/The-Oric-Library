# The-Oric-Library
This is the complete PHP Source code of the [Oric Library](https://library.defence-force.org).

The covers of the books and magazines are present in the repository, but not the actual content due to obvious copyright reasons.

Design wise, this is standard PHP code, there is no database involved: Everything is just stored in a big array, which honestly for such a small set of data is perfectly fine.

Regarding the code quality, I've never had any proper PHP training, so I mostly applied what I knew of other languages, so it's probably going to make proper PHP developers to gouge their eyes out in disgust, but heck, as far as I can see the code runs.
